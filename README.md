## 📦 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bf56rrxbrs-crypto/agent-ai.git
cd agent-ai

# Run the demo (Python 3.7+)
python main.py

# Run tests
python -m unittest discover -s . -p "test_*.py"
```

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### Customer Support Automation
```python
# Adaptive customer support with mood detection
user_profiling = UserProfilingSystem()
profile = user_profiling.get_or_create_profile("customer-123")

# Detect customer mood
mood = user_profiling.detect_mood_from_text("I'm frustrated with this issue!")

# Adapt response based on mood and preferences
response = user_profiling.adapt_response_to_user(
    "customer-123",
    "Here's how to fix that issue.",
    current_mood=mood
)
# Output: "I understand this can be frustrating. Here's how to fix that issue."
```

### Healthcare Data Privacy
```python
# Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance with differential privacy
security_mgr = SecurityManager()

# Aggregate patient data with privacy protection
patient_ages = [45, 52, 38, 61, 29]
private_avg_age = security_mgr.aggregate_with_privacy(
    patient_ages, 
    "mean", 
    epsilon=1.0
)
# Returns noisy average to protect individual privacy
```

### Content Marketing Automation
```python
# Generate personalized marketing content
writer = CreativeWriter()
content = writer.generate_content("marketing-slogan", {
    "product": "AI Assistant",
    "benefit": "saves time"
})

# A/B test different versions
variants = ["AI that works for you", "Your intelligent assistant"]
ab_test = writer.create_ab_test("campaign-001", variants)
```

### Voice-Enabled Navigation
```python
# Process voice commands and respond with TTS
mm_handler = MultimodalHandler()
mm_handler.enable_voice_commands()
mm_handler.enable_tts()

# Process voice input
cmd = mm_handler.process_voice_command(None, "Navigate to downtown")

# Generate voice response
tts_result = mm_handler.text_to_speech(
    "Navigating to downtown. ETA 15 minutes.",
    voice=TTSVoice.FEMALE_PROFESSIONAL
)
```
